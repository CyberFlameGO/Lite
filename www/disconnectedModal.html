          <strong>
            If the disconnect has occured immediately after loading Lite
            &hellip;
          </strong>
          <p>
            This is often caused by AWSs caching, and Lite is trying to
            reconnect to an old server instance. Until we find a better
            solution, here are some ways to solve this issue:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Try refreshing the page</li>
            <li>Try in a different browser, <em>or</em> in a private window</li>
            <li>
              Try clearing your cookies/website data for this page
              (lite.docker.stat.auckland.ac.nz)
            </li>
            <li>Contact us if you still have no success</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>
            If the disconnect occured after you uploaded some data &hellip;
          </strong>
          <p>
            There may be an issue with the dataset, or Lite is running into
            trouble for some other reason.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you haven't already, try loading the data again</li>
            <li>
              If you are on a Mac, ensure you are <strong>not</strong> trying to
              upload a Numbers (.numbers) file, as Lite cannot read these
            </li>
            <li>
              Try a different dataset. If you get the same issue, it might be an
              issue with Lite. In that case, please contact us.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>
            If the disconnect occured after you performed some action &hellip;
          </strong>
          <p>
            This is likely an issue with Lite. Please contact us and quote the
            above session ID.
